## Des Moines Farmers Market

### Things to keep in mind: the DMC Farmers Market will attract numerous tourists (except for the current COVID-19 polocy)

We are expecting more customers and communters to use our bikesharing during the farmers market event, which allows us to implement more bikes.

## Des Moines Population Impact on the Bikesharing Program

This is a summary of the comparison between the NYC and DMC **1) population/gender distribution and 2) McDonald's density**.
It is clear that these two cities have a similar pattern in gender and McDonald's density, even though the entire population of NYC is much higher
and the McDonald's density is a little bit higher. These results indicate the investment of a bikesharing program in DMC is acceptable referred to the NYC mode.
